<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computational Mathematics at **Wuhan University**.

My research focuses on the mathematical applications in medical physics, with a particular emphasis on planning optimization algorithms for proton radiation therapy. So far, I have published **5 papers** in SCIE-indexed journals such as *Medical Physics* and *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, as well as **4 conference abstracts** in the field of medical physics.

In addition, I serve as a reviewer for several reputable journals, including *Medical Physics* and *Physics in Medicine & Biology*.
